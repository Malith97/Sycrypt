# Sycrypt

Like other password manager, Sycryptr also use a master password for encryption & decryption. All your credentials are encrypted.
Our most important design guideline is we DO NOT upload your database to anywhere. Not to a cloud or self-hosted server. We DO NOT require internet permission in this app. All your credentials are in your local storage safely.
